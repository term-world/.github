# `term-world`

This project aims to apply “gamification” pedagogy in design and development of a new approach to the computer science course (CMPSC 100) at Allegheny College. The outcome, 
a persistent, immersive digital environment called `term-world` would provide both a playground and persistent digital metaphor through which to consider real-world ethical 
and civil questions regarding governance, justice, equity, and other social infrastructures not typically included in computer science education. This project leverages both 
interdisciplinary principles and students as co-developers to explore new applications of pedagogy not necessarily limited to the discipline of computer science.

This work is generously funded by the Allegheny College Undergraduate Research, Scholarship, and Creative Activities (URSCA) office, namely through the following Allegheny College 
internal funding sources:

* McCune Dean’s Fund for Student and Faculty Research fund
* Louis Jefferson Long Student/Faculty Research fund
* Richard J. Cook & Teresa M. Lahti Endowment for Research and Creative Activity fund

We are grateful for their support of this project.

This work is intellectually indebted to [Donald Bitzer](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/people/bitzer/)'s creation of the PLATO system which we learned about by way of Brian Dear's compelling, well-researched account of that system, [_The Friendly Orange Glow_](http://www.friendlyorangeglow.com/).
