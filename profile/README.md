# `term-world`

This project aims to apply “gamification” pedagogy in design and development of a new approach to the introductory computer science courses in Python. The outcome, a persistent, immersive digital environment called `term-world` provides both a playground and persistent digital metaphor through which to consider real-world ethical and civil questions regarding governance, justice, equity, and other social infrastructures not typically included in CS education. This project leverages interdisciplinary principles and considers students as co-developers to explore new applications of pedagogy not necessarily limited to the discipline of computer science.

## Organization

This repository contains all of the technical and curriculum materials necessary to run an instance of `term-world`. 

### Technical projects

### Curriculum

#### `term-world`

The `term-world` curriculum focuses on civic participation, data transparency, and civil society as vehicles for motivating student engagement with and understanding of responsibilities to a neighborly world.
